    <h1>Touch Demonstration</h1>
    <p>
      This page is intended to demonstrate the benefits of using a 3rd party library
      to handle click and touch events. This page should be accessed from a touch device
      (tablet, smartphone, or equivalent). This page lists various UI elements.
      Some have javascript listeners and some use standard HTMl actions.
